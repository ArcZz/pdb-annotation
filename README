Before you run this project:
1. Create database schema pdb, username cbio, password cbio in mysql
2. Download sequences are downloaded from (ftp://ftp.rcsb.org/pub/pdb/derived_data/pdb_seqres.txt.gz) and gunzip it to ${workdir}
3. Download gene sequences from Ensembl (ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-84/fasta/homo_sapiens/pep/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.pep.all.fa.gz) and gunzip it to ${workdir}
4. In your code workspace, git clone https://github.com/cBioPortal/pdb-annotation.git
5. Change settings in org/cbioportal/pdb_annotation/util/Constants.java. 
	(i) Change workspace to the input sequences located ${workdir}. 
	(ii)Change resource_dir to "~/pdb-annotation/pdb/src/main/resources/"  
	(iii)Change ensembl_input_interval for memory performance consideration
	(iv) * If you want to use other test ensembl sequences, please change both ensembl_download_file and ensembl_fasta_file in your workspace
6. mvn package
7. in pdb-annotation/pdb/target/ java -jar -Xmx7000m pdb-0.1.0.jar
8. Go to mysql to check the results
